  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 150%; color: FireBrick">R</span>ecently, I stumbled across a quote from a Mozilla developer
    <a href="">about the tension inherent in creating standards</a>:
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 50px">
    Implentations and specifications have to do a delicate dance together.
    You don’t want implementations to happen before the specification is finished,
    because people start depending on the details of implementations and that constrains
    the specification. However, you also don’t want the specification to be finished
    before there are implementations and author experience with those implementations,
    because you need the feedback. There is unavoidable tension here, but we just have to muddle on through.
  </p>
  <p>
    Keep this quote in the back of your mind, and let me explain how HTML5 came to be.

  <h2>
    MIME TYPES
  </h2>
  <p>
    This book is about HTML5, not previous versions of HTML, and not any version of XHTML.
    But to understand the history of HTML5 and the motivations behind it, you need to understand
    a few technical details first. Specifically, MIME types.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every time your web browser requests a page, the web server sends “headers” before it
    sends the actual page markup. These headers are normally invisible, although there are
    web development tools that will make them visible if you’re interested. But the headers
    are important, because they tell your browser how to interpret the page markup that follows.
    The most important header is called <code>Content-Type</code>, and it looks like this:
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 100px">
    <code>Content-Type: text/html</code>
  </p>
  <p>
    “<code>text/html</code>” is called the “content type” or “MIME type” of the page. This header is the
    <strong>only</strong> thing that determines what a particular resource truly is, and therefore how it
    should be rendered. Images have their own MIME types (<code>image/jpeg</code> for JPEG images,
    <code>image/png</code> for PNG images, and so on). JavaScript files have their own MIME type.
    CSS stylesheets have their own MIME type. Everything has its own MIME type. The web runs on MIME types.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course, reality is more complicated than that. The first generation of web servers (and I’m
    talking web servers from 1993) didn’t send the <code>Content-Type</code> header because it didn’t exist yet.
    (It wasn’t invented until 1994.) For compatibility reasons that date all the way back to 1993,
    some popular web browsers will ignore the <code>Content-Type</code> header under certain circumstances. (This
    is called “content sniffing.”) But as a general rule of thumb, everything you’ve ever looked at
    on the web — HTML pages, images, scripts, videos, PDFs, anything with a URL — has been served to
    you with a specific MIME type in the <code>Content-Type</code> header.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tuck that under your hat. We’ll come back to it.

  <h2>
    BACK TO THE W3C
  </h2>
  <img src="http://diveintohtml5.info/i/openclipart.org_johnny_automatic_a_dog_and_a_cat_with_an_umbrella.png" align="right">
  <p>
    For two and a half years, the W3C and the WHAT Working Group largely ignored each other. While the
    WHAT Working Group focused on web forms and new HTML features, the W3C HTML Working Group was busy
    with version 2.0 of XHTML. But by October 2006, it was clear that the WHAT Working Group had picked
    up serious momentum, while XHTML 2 was still languishing in draft form, unimplemented by any major
    browser. In October 2006, Tim Berners-Lee, the founder of the W3C itself, <a href="">announced that the W3C
    would work together with the WHAT Working Group</a> to evolve HTML.
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 50px">
    Some things are clearer with hindsight of several years. It is necessary to evolve HTML incrementally.
    The attempt to get the world to switch to XML, including quotes around attribute values and slashes
    in empty tags and namespaces all at once didn’t work. The large HTML-generating public did not move,
    largely because the browsers didn’t complain. Some large communities did shift and are enjoying the fruits
    of well-formed systems, but not all. It is important to maintain HTML incrementally, as well as continuing
    a transition to well-formed world, and developing more power in that world.
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 50px">
    The plan is to charter a completely new HTML group. Unlike the previous one, this one will be chartered
    to do incremental improvements to HTML, as also in parallel xHTML. It will have a different chair and
    staff contact. It will work on HTML and xHTML together. We have strong support for this group, from many
    people we have talked to, including browser makers.
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 50px">
    There will also be work on forms. This is a complex area, as existing HTML forms and XForms are both
    form languages. HTML forms are ubiquitously deployed, and there are many implementations and users
    of XForms. Meanwhile, the Webforms submission has suggested sensible extensions to HTML forms. The
    plan is, informed by Webforms, to extend HTML forms.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the first things the newly re-chartered W3C HTML Working Group decided was to rename “Web Applications
    1.0” to “HTML5.” And here we are, diving into HTML5.

  <h2>
    POSTSCRIPT
  </h2>
  <p>
    In October 2009, the W3C <a href="">shut down the XHTML 2 Working Group</a> and <a href="">issued this statement
    to explain their decision</a>:
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 50px">
    When W3C announced the HTML and XHTML 2 Working Groups in March 2007, we indicated that we
    would continue to monitor the market for XHTML 2. W3C recognizes the importance of a clear
    signal to the community about the future of HTML.
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 50px">
    While we recognize the value of the XHTML 2 Working Group’s contributions over the years,
    after discussion with the participants, W3C management has decided to allow the Working Group’s
    charter to expire at the end of 2009 and not to renew it.
